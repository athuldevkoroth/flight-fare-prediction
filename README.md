# ✈️Flight Fare Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts flight ticket prices based on various travel features such as airline, source, destination, duration, stops, and more.
It includes the complete notebook, trained model, dataset, and requirements to reproduce the results.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── FlightFare.ipynb        # Jupyter Notebook (full EDA + model building)
├── dataset.csv             # Training dataset
├── requirements.txt        # Required Python libraries
├── model.zip               # Zipped trained model (.pkl inside)
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```


## 🧠 What This Project Includes

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training (RandomForest / DecisionTree)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation & metrics
- Exported trained model (model.pkl inside model.zip)

## 📦 Requirements

This project uses only a few basic Python libraries:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

All dependencies are listed in **requirements.txt**.

## 📦 Model File (.zip)

GitHub doesn’t allow uploading files larger than 25 MB directly.
So the model is compressed into model.zip — unzip it to get model.pkl.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Convert this into a web application (Flask / FastAPI + HTML/CSS + JS)
- Add a proper preprocessing script for production use
- Build a UI for fare prediction
